## draw.io
The png images which ended by `.drawio.png` were generated using [draw.io](https://www.draw.io/).

The png files are shipped as metadata with the draw.io schema. So they can be displayed and modified using either the online version of [draw.io](https://www.draw.io/) or [draw-desktop](https://github.com/jgraph/drawio-desktop)
